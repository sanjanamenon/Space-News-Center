<th> Missions planned by ISRO </th>
<tr> <td> 1. Mission Name : Chandrayaan-2 <hr>
- Chandrayaan-2 will be India's second mission to the Moon which will include an orbiter and lander-rover module.<br>
- Chandrayaan-2 will be launched on India's Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV-MkII) in the last quarter of 2018. <br>
- The science goals of the mission are to further improve the understanding of the origin and evolution of the Moon. </td> </tr>

<tr> <td> 2. Mission Name : GSAT-11<hr>
- GSAT-11 is based on I-6K bus which is under advanced stage of development.<br>
- The spacecraft can generate 10-12 KW of power and can support payload power of 8KW.<br>
- The payload configuration is on-going.<br>
- The payload is configured to be operated as a high data throughput satellite to be released in orbit in 2018.</td> </tr> </table>
