WASHINGTON: After President Trump told Marines in California that he believed the U.S. military should have a space force, there was confusion.
Rapuano testified at a hearing of the House Armed Services subcommittee on strategic forces on the administration's fiscal year 2019 budget request for national security space programs.<br>
Also at the witness table were Gen. John 'Jay' Raymond, commander of Air Force Space Command, and Betty Sapp, director of the National Reconnaissance Office.<br>
Subcommittee Chairman Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Ala.), who has led a congressional push to create a space corps, was visibly giddy. "I am so excited to have the support of President Trump as we work towards this goal and look forward to making it a reality in the near future," he said.
