<th> 3. Astronomy </th>
<tr> <td> <b> 3.1 Mission Name : ASTROSAT </b> <br> <hr>
- ASTROSAT is the first dedicated Indian Astronomy satellite mission launched by ISRO on 28 September 2015, which will be helpful in enable multi-wavelength observations of the celestial bodies and cosmic sources in X-ray and UV spectral bands simultaneously. </br>
- The scientific payloads cover the Visible, UV, soft and hard X-ray regimes. <br>
- The uniqueness of ASTROSAT lie in its wide spectral coverage extending over visible, UV, soft and hard X-ray regions. </td> </tr> <br> <br>
<tr> <td><b> 3.2 Mission Name : South Asia Satellite</b> <br> <hr>
- South Asia Satellite was launched on 5 May 2017. <br>
- This is a satellite which has been developed by ISRO for South Asian Nations. <br>
- Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced this in November 2014 during the 18th SAARC session. </td> </tr> </table> </p> <br>

<tr> <td> 2. Mission Name : Aditya <hr>
- ISRO plans to carry out a mission to the Sun by the year 2019ï¿½20.<br>
- The probe is named as Aditya-1 and will weigh about 400 kg.<br>
- It is the First Indian-based Solar Coronagraph to study solar Corona in visible and near IR bands.<br>
- The main objective is to study the Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) and consequently the crucial physical parameters for space weather such as the coronal magnetic field structures, the evolution of the coronal magnetic field, etc. </td> </tr>

<tr> <td> 3. Mission Name : AVATAR <hr>
- AVATAR from "Aerobic Vehicle for Transatmospheric Hypersonic Aerospace Transportation" is a concept for a manned single-stage reusable spaceplane capable of horizontal takeoff and landing, by India's Defence Research and Development Organisation.<br>
- The mission concept is for low-cost military and commercial satellite space launches, as well as for space tourism.<br>
