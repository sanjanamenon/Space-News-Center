	1. Ancient Oceans on Mars May Have Been Older and Shallower Than Thought </b> </p>

<p>
The rise of the largest volcanoes in the solar system may have led Mars to possess oceans hundreds of millions of years earlier than previously thought, a new study finds.<br>
Although Mars is now cold and dry, there is widespread evidence that oceans once covered much of the Red Planet's surface.<br>
However, there are scientists who hotly debate this idea, arguing that there are plenty of signs against Mars once having seas.<br>
For example, previous research found signs of ancient shorelines lining the northern plains of Mars for thousands of miles.<br>
However, skeptics point out that shorelines generally trace a mostly constant sea-level surface.<br>
In contrast, these Martian features are very irregular, "varying in elevation by up to several kilometers," study lead author Robert Citron, a planetary scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, told Space.com.</p> <hr>
